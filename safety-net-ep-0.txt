breaking into your accounts
corrupting your files.
Think of the internet, the very reason you are able to read this article right now (also the very reason I was able to publish this article :). Well, the internet is an amazing thing, we have access to vast amounts of information, we can get in touch with our friends, family and people who are hundreds of miles away from where we are. The internet is also acting as a workplace or learning institution nowadays. (There are so many other things, but you get the point).

Some people have taken advantage of the internet to fufill their malevolent and selfish needs. This has become a problem to our society and also to our privacy and security. These attackers ambush people in a subtle but effective way and sometimes use simple bait to capture their prey.

The title of this series is called "Safety Net" because it will help you find SAFETY whilst you are on the interNET. (PLEASE TAKE NOTE!) Some attacks are inevitable, but that should not stop us from taking better care of ourselves whilst we are on the internet or getting things from the internet.

Throughout the course of this series, we will find out about keeping yourself safe (well, to some extend) on the internet and some practices that we do on a regular basis that make us potential victims of internet attacks, and so much more. So follow me so that you will not miss out on any of my interesting articles.
